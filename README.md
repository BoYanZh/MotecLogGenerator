# MotecLogGenerator

A single Python CLI for converting motorsports telemetry into verified MoTeC
`.ld` and `.ldx` files.

Supported inputs:

- iRacing `.ibt`
- RaceChrono `.rcz` and CSV
- AIM `.xrk` / `.xrz`
- Garmin `.fit`
- Racelogic VBOX `.vbo`
- COBB Accessport and PB Buddy CSV
- raw CAN logs with a DBC file
- generic CSV

The converter normalizes common channel names and units, resamples channels,
adds generic derived channels, preserves source channels such as RCZ ECU pitch,
and writes `.ld`/`.ldx` through a verified temporary-file pipeline. Existing
outputs are never replaced unless `--force` is supplied, and the input file is
never used as an output target.

## Install

Python 3.8 through 3.14 is supported. AIM XRK/XRZ import requires Python 3.10
or newer because `libxrk` does not publish Python 3.8/3.9 builds; all other
input formats remain available on Python 3.8/3.9.

```bash
python -m pip install .
motec-log --help
```

Install only the optional parsers you need:

```bash
python -m pip install ".[can]"
python -m pip install ".[fit]"
python -m pip install ".[xrk]"
```

For every optional parser and the test suite:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest -q
```

## Use

The installed command is the primary interface:

```bash
motec-log session.ibt AUTO
motec-log session.rcz RCZ
motec-log session.xrk XRK
motec-log session.fit FIT
motec-log vbox.vbo VBO
motec-log can.log CAN --dbc vehicle.dbc
```

The package module is an equivalent fallback:

```bash
python -m motec_log_generator session.rcz AUTO
```

`AUTO` detects IBT, RCZ, XRK/XRZ, FIT, VBO, PB Buddy, AIM/RaceChrono CSV,
Accessport CSV, and generic CSV inputs. Explicit choices are `CAN`, `CSV`,
`ACCESSPORT`, `RACECHRONO`, `RCZ`, `PBBUDDY`, `VBO`, `IBT`, `XRK`, and `FIT`.

Common options:

```bash
motec-log session.rcz AUTO --output converted.ld
motec-log session.rcz AUTO --output converted.ld --force
motec-log session.rcz AUTO --csv
motec-log session.fit AUTO --csv --csv-wallclock
motec-log session.rcz AUTO --g-source sensor --frequency 25
```

Run `motec-log --help` for the authoritative option list.

## Behavior

- RCZ sessions with multiple stints are split automatically when `--stint all`
  is used.
- RCZ `--lap N` selects the reconstructed lap number within a stint and rebases
  that single-lap export to zero elapsed time.
- `--min-lap-sec` controls the minimum reconstructed RCZ out/timed/in segment
  duration; the legacy `--min_lap_sec` spelling remains accepted.
- An RCZ leading segment that starts at 5 km/h or faster is retained as a
  `Partial Out Lap`, with a warning that the source recording began mid-lap.
- `.ld` and `.ldx` are staged, parsed back, and committed as a pair.
- `--force` is required to replace existing generated files.
- `--g-source {auto,sensor,calc}` selects hardware or GPS-derived G channels.
- `--mask-interp-gaps` leaves long sampling gaps as `NaN` instead of bridging
  them.
- `--csv`, `--gpx`, and `--kml` add optional exports.
