"""CSV telemetry export for MotecLogGenerator.

Writes all resampled channels as a tabular CSV with a header row of
canonical MoTeC channel names.  Designed to be imported into AIM
RaceStudio / RaceChrono RaceStudio CSV import wizards (column mapping
is done manually in the target application).

Time is exported as elapsed seconds since log start by default, or as
the log's wall-clock timestamp when --csv-wallclock is passed.
